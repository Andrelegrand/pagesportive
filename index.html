                Leo Messi throughout his career played 1027 games and scored 806 goals, which is 0.781 goals per game. It's better than CR7 which is 0.72 per game with 837 goals for 1166 games. <br>
                Moreover, Leo Messi has given 92 more assists than Cristiano Ronaldo during his career (1163 to Messi for 1071 to CR7). Messi was decisive (assist or goal) every 72'41". Cristiano Ronaldo was decisive for him every 88’26 “. <br>
                Leo Messi scores 85% of his goals with his left leg, using his right leg to score 1 in 8 goals. Due to his size, he only scores 3% of his goals with a header. <br>
                The two goals Messi scored with other body parts were with the hand at Espanyol on June 9, 2007 in La Liga, and with the chest in the 2009 World Cup final against Estudiantes de La Plata. <br>
                Depuis ce 13 juin 2020, Messi est le seul joueur à avoir marqué 20 buts en championnat pendant 12 saisons consécutives. <br>
                Leo Messi scores 8 out of 10 goals in the game. His stats break down as follows: 1 out of 8 penalty goals and 1 out of 14 free kick goals. <br>
                Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have been shattering goalscoring records for years and are fighting a hand-to-hand battle to be the best. Not free from controversy, the Portuguese has the same number of Golden Balls as Messi, five.
                In the goalscoring section with their respective national teams, there is a big difference in numbers in favor of the Portuguese, but when it comes to the quality of the rivals, the balance is chosen for Messi's side.

                Cristiano Ronaldo has played 139 more matches than Leo Messi in his career and has scored just 31 more goals than the Argentine. <br>
                If we add the goals and assists, we can say that, throughout his career, Leo Messi has scored 29 more goals than Cristiano Ronaldo, although he has played 146 fewer matches. <br>
                Cristiano Ronaldo scores 63% of his goals with his right leg, nearly 2 in 10 with his left leg and almost 2 in 10 with his head. <br>
                Apart from these more conventional goals, Cristiano Ronaldo scored an elbow goal against Athletic Bilbao in the 2014/2015 season. Cristiano Ronaldo's other "unusual" goal was scored with the zigounette. <br>
                Cristiano Ronaldo scores 75% of his goals in the course of the game. Unsurprisingly, he scores more often on penalties: 16% of his goals. <br>
                The Portuguese has scored 43% of his goals with the selection against the combined 'Top 50' while Messi has done so in 62% of his goals. <br>
                While it's true that Ronaldo has scored 122 goals for Portugal, only 48 of them (43%) have come against teams in the world's 'Top 50'. In the case of Messi, he scored against 37 different teams and 19 of these teams were ranked in the top 50. He scored 64 goals to these teams, the goalscoring percentage against top 50 teams is 61.54%
